   -  An interface in java is a blueprint of a class.
   - It has static constants and abstract methods
   - The interface in java is mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only
   abstract methods in java interface, not method body. It use to achieve
   abstraction and multiple inheritance in java.

   - in other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables.
   - it cannot have a method body

   # Why use Java interface
   - it is used to achieve abstraction
   - by interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
   - It can be used to achieve loose coupling
